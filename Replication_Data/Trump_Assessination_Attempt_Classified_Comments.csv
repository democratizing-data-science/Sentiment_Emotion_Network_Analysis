The shooter was located on the end of the building next to the grassy area, as can be seen in multiple attendees photos. The incorrect location next to the parking lot is now showing up in reports. This location is behind trees between the SS snipers and the shooter. Additionally these reports are changing which SS sniper team eliminated the shooter threat. The SS sniper team that took out the shooter are on top of the barn location that is stage right, on Trump's right facing out from the stage. In photos and videos the two SS snipers located on the right of the stage can clearly be seen observing the shooter through their scopes and waiting until the shooter shoots Trump, before the SS sniper opens fire on the shooter. The SS snipers located stage right, could not see the shooter if he was located at the end of the building next to the parking lot and behind the row of trees blocking that view. The end of the building next to the grassy area has a clear view of the shooter, as can be seen in all photos and videos. The new story is the second SS sniper team located stage left... shot the shooter. This second team was not primarily facing and surveying the building where the shooter was located. This is a redirect of the facts of where the shooter was located and which SS sniper team had the shooter under surveillance and shot him within 2-3 seconds after the shooter shot Trump. This is a cover up for the fact that the SS had the shooter under direct surveillance well before he started shooting, killing one and wounding two other attendees and shooting Trump.

In addition, the second SS sniper team was not accounted for in your video.

V1,0.801,0.948,"Please do a better job of recounting the facts before posting a video. Here is my take from my research... first shot missed trump, second hit his ear third shot also missed Trump. The string of fire that was 4 shots stooped when you heard a trailing shot likely the first shot the Counter sniper team when engaging the shooter and was followed by another Safety shot seconds later. I believe that is why he didn't do a full mag dump as he was neutralized..... It was reported by in SS insider that neither of the SS counter snipers shown on the roof fired a shot. A local law enforcement team engaged the shooter from a different location with a 308. Both of the SS counter snipers had 300 Win Mag's. I saw the image of the suspect deceased and he was clearly not shot with a 300 win Mag as his head was still intact. It appears like the shooter was hit on the upper left side of his head possible hair line and the bullet exited lower part of his neck just below his right ear at the toward the back of his lower jaw. So would suspect that round was fired from his left side in a 20-40 degree angle to his shooting position. The reason the shooter missed is due to the fact he was using an ACOG sight with a 4 min dot. At 150 yards this covers 6 inches. See if you can validate these facts for us.

And with that new position ,there was a tree in the way blocking him from the snipers on the roof behind Trump. And who shot Trump? The new position makes it less likely that a bullet could have grazed the ear and not hit the head. So it looks like three shooters, in addition to the snipers on the roof, who don't appear to have shot anyone except maybe the guy on the water tower that might have shot Crooks.

V1,0.776,0.948,"As long as we accept FBI's story of a \lone gunman\"" we are being lied to. Crooks was the patsy in the mold of Lee Harvey Oswald, and he missed... but the bigger picture is the audio propagation delay analysis examining the podium audio (which is professional level audio recording) clearly prove NOT 1 but 2 shooters: one at Crooks location (nominal 150yds) that fired the first 3 shots and THEN the next 4 or 5 were fired from a clearly VERY different rifle which analysis proves fired at a nominal 400 yds. from the podium - these distances are based on physics of propagation delay, and they use a fairly straightforward formula comparing the report of the supersonic \""bark\"" of the bullet as it passes the podium against the air propagation sound velocity (i.e.: 343 meters per second) of the much more delayed \""shot sound\"" arriving to the podium mic... which, in the case of the 4th shot onward was MUCH later. With this knowledge you can leave guessing behind and mathematically ascertain the nominal distance between the shooter and the podium. I have served as both Sr. and Principal RF & Electromagnetics engineer in global corporations and have spent decades routinely doing professional propagation analysis professionally for Radio, Fiber, and Free-Space Optics networks both to provide distance to fault, and to synchronize simulcasts with minimal inter-symbol interference - while the assassination attempt is is audio, the propagation analysis method to prove distance with only a few velocity changes is virtually identical. There are a small amount of YouTube videos that use this scientifically valid analysis, and at least a few of them go on to show OTHER rooftops well outside of the perimeter where an assassin could have been positioned at 400 yds.

Typically a right hand shooter would pull a shot to the right yet in this case the shooter misses left roughly 5 to 6 inches from center mass. Here is why, Mr Trump turned his head just before the shooter was going to send the bullet, it startled the inexperienced shooter and panic followed, the shooter pulls to the left and over corrected for mr Trumps movement and missed.

There was another sniper team on the roof of another building more to the right and apparently they could see the shooter and were more likely the team that took him out. Hopefully this will be all clarified in coming investigations. Also would like to know the position of the water tower relative to Trump and relative to the snipers and whether or not a second shooter could have been there as well. Is there any video footage of the water tower?,UgzUWjTy540lfgB_Vr14AaABAg,3094
V1,0.614,0.948,Modeling does not appear to be correct? (1:11) Shooter was shown on open side of building but post assassin videos and other sources show shooter on the other (left looking down) end of building and behind the very slight ridge line... this video depicts him in the open side slope toward the podium/event. vid seems to show roof of prefab steel bldg as flat? Had typical 1:12 pitch in other videos. this vid seems to imply SS shooters on barn nearest shooter made the kill shot? That position was somewhat visually occluded by trees due to assassin being on end of bldg. w ladder- nearer parking lot; see (:32). This presentation seems to conflict w/ many other modeling displays online.,Ugyjohr2zbIOCFeGi7d4AaABAg,4603

We know this because in the photo the President was raising his right hand to touch his injured ear. But you did seem to imply that this was the first bullet by showing a 3D model where the bullet in the photo was an inch behind his head. In fact, there's no depth perception in that photo, so that bullet could be in front of his head.",UgwWfhr_0wPCFtKZ1Xd4AaABAg,10336
V1,0.614,0.948,Wait ? What ? Not a word about the water tower ? Please allow me to map an assassination for you . The guy you catch is the patsy. He's the show card. Disposable. The guy you never see / saw is the killer - who in this case failed his mission very likely because of Crooks being seen and jumping the plan. There were at least 11 shots fired over 15 seconds captured by sound analysis. The media is suppressing witness statements about a shooter on the water tower. A 300 - 400 yd shot from the water tower is short / easy work for anyone with experience. TOO EASY !!! The plan ( the art ) is to hide your shot - AND ESCAPE - in the middle of Crooks and counter snipers shooting at each other.,Ugx1htn1Ep2FbxnbgUx4AaABAg,11985
V1,0.607,0.948,"Crooks, the patsy, was in the MIDDLE of the building g! NOT by upstairs window of the 2 story building! However, THAT is the true line of sight and where the REAL shooter was... well, one of them. I believe there was at least another one on the water tower. Also, that was NOT the Counter Sniper team that ended him. It was from a different, unseen team using a Knight's SR25 suppressed .308Win and NOT the .300WinMag from the team being shown everywhere. Crooks would have been totally unrecognizable had he been hit by .300WinMag that close! Crooks job was to be conspicuous and draw attention, then be the fall guy/patsy. They did it before successfully, why wouldn't they do it again? Especially to the president they hated to most and was going to be coming for them once elected!",Ugw8w4qQVmAtP4wtYJR4AaABAg,407

V1,0.607,0.948,"A few critical details you got wrong: the snipers ALREADY had eyes on the shooter prior to him firing a shot. There's a video showing this. It's also believed that there were two counter sniper teams and the one farthest from the shooter made the kill shot.

No shots fired from the snipers behind Trump at all...",UgxPQ3F_WkIhqySmyKp4AaABAg,5461
V1,0.599,0.948,"WOW! This is exactly the far-left narrative! 24 hours ago I already knew more about the assassination attempt than you based on facts. Are you paid for disinformation? Trump was hit from at least 488 yards the SS said at the beginning. Crooks was only 148 yards away. And he could not even hit a barrel at a 40 yards range, that is why he was kicked out on Day 1 of the school shooting team. About the distance: a water tower behind Crooks at 500 yards distance was the shooting spot. 3 separate witnesses saw a shooter there on top at that specific moment. Crooks was in the middle of that fire-line. So, why not telling that story? What is your intention here that it was only a one-shooter? And why the mention of him being a registered Republican? Liz Cheney and Nikki Haley begged Democrats to register as a Republican to vote in the GOP primaries against Trump (and for Haley and Cheney). They got busted and failed dramatically. Why not mentioning that? And why not mentioning he donated to BlueAct, a very radical far-left donor group. To radical Democrats only. Having a secret agenda? The water tower is between Butler Gymnastics Club and Butler Farm Shows (Trump stage). The Crooks rooftop was in the middle. And there was already a ladder et by someone else than Crooks. And that particular roof was evaluated as a high potential threat for a sniper. Ladder still standing? And Crooks had encountered 3 times with law enforcement and still was not stopped. Even a local LEO climbed (yeah, he was not woke enough apparently) on that rooftop and spoke to him, and left! He just left. How can a unidentified person with a rifle, AK-15, be allowed to walk around and climb a high-potential assassination spot? And what for the SS snipers in sight were waiting for? They waited 42 seconds, 8 rounds. They got a sign. And then start shooting a person, Crooks, who never shot at Trump. Why not mentioning that? Why all those assumptions based on speculations? This is the official narrative that they want you to believe. Also doing your own investigation? Or just being another propaganda machine for the far-left? There was a sniper on that water tower. I assume he was a Special Force sniper that gave the sign CLEAR to the SS sniper to shoot Crooks. On purpose because he was installed there by them. That water water shooter Trump in the head, and then he felt down. That sniper was so sure he immediately signed CLEAR (mission accomplished) to the SS snipers, and then the execution of Crooks. If they had shot Crooks prior to the Trump assassination, then it Ould look foolish: death people can not shoot a president! And Trump ducked, that the water tower sniper did not know. He only knew he hit Trump's head. Turned out he hit his ear because of a slight move, and then ducked. That duck was a great move, otherwise the water tower shooter would have continued his shot and had given then the sign CLEAR to the SS snipers. Why do I miss those kind of information here, and do I read this official narrative by far-left democrats only? No journalistic curiosity? I knew this yesterday, more than 24 hours ago. So, do you research before trying to assume something.",UgwLq-iBy4QFPbkTsRh4AaABAg,13363

V1,0.592,0.948,There's reporting of someone who was sitting on the right side bleacher that would be her right which means if you're looking at Trump speaking she was on the left which she is saying is where Cory was killed that bullet came from the water tower so I believe that crooks got three or four shots off and that the other four or five shots came from the water tower to try to finish the job or ensure the job was done and then that single last shot was them killing crooks.

Then REAL ASSASSIN is on the water tower 300 yards behind 20 yo he fired over the boys head. SS snipers had him in their sights 3 minutes before 1st shot and their shot was the last shot fired on the audio. Current democrats appointed Assistant Director to the FBI was in the stands woman in black hat, dark glasses and white tank top behind Trumps left shoulder. She was signaling their assassin on the water tower. Dig in that direction. Now my question is .......if they say 20 yo rounds match any slugs found then I know the FBI either changed out firing pins on rifles or complete cover up and casings were planted and boy never fired.",UgyLA6DcL8TFl1WK0Ap4AaABAg,849
V1,0.59,0.948,There were 2 shooters! You can tell by the audio. The first shooter fired from inside a building that was behind Crooks. He fired three shots through an open window. You can tell because there was no echo as the sound was absorbed inside the building. The 2nd shooter was Crooks on the roof and he fired 6 shots. There is a very clear ECHO as a rifle would make if fired in the open.,Ugwue-1mMytkEPvh5pd4AaABAg,4995
V1,0.59,0.948,"Solid work here. One thing I suspect and we have not heard yet: pause the video at 3:26 I don't think the sniper team with the blue line fired. In the video, one appears to duck and the other appears to be shifting his weapon when Crooks is hit. I think it's the 2nd team on the other roof to our right. The \view\"" works better too, since Crooks was using the trees as cover - he knew the snipers were there, he'd scoped them earlier on the rangefinder. The other sniper team would have less foliage branches etc to see through, and these trees are all in full bloom, so with the video showing the blue line team ducking and moving, we see they would have an impossible shot through dense tree cover. That's why I think it's the guys on the right (in the pic). Best work on it I've seen too, again, good work guys.""",Ugyv0fpWB-yszrCmWI94AaABAg,12365
V1,0.588,0.948,"The shooter was in a different position on the roof to that depicted here. In the position shown here he could barely see Trump. He was much nearer the right hand edge of the roof from his perspective which would have given him more of a view. I'm still curious how someone was shot on the seats behind trump though, as that would seem to be an impossible angle from that roof unless the bullets came in through the back of those seats. Also the video footage shows the shooter's body well behind the ridge of the roof he is on, its unlikely he moved after being shot so it is unclear how he managed to get a view from that position or indeed how the snipers managed to hit him. Many unanswered questions on the mechanics of this for me.",UgzuON4aNp3LC9xfzLV4AaABAg,12113
V1,0.586,0.948,"You showed the location of the sniper and location of the counter-sniper who killed the murderer.

V1,0.583,0.948,"Trump gets shot??? No one saw the blood on trump until AFTER he held his neck, his ear looks in pretty good condition after being shot. That's coming from a veteran Army Medic. All those people sat behind and hardly any footage or pictures from that angle and what there was is horrible quality? No drones? Never in history has a politician stayed on stage AFTER an assassination attempt waving at the crowd! There's a lot of questions that still need answers and in the meantime I'm calling this a fake propaganda exercise. There's a slight delay due to sound waves depending which video you watch. The first shot hit trump. He held his neck just AFTER the first shot was heard, the que? Then it appears the police sniper moved or fired immediately from the roof from the movement on the gun. They said the suspect fired five shots but how could he AFTER the police sniper had fired, police sniper only fired once and didn't appear to even try to shoot again or at all? Were the other shots made by other police or the suspect gunman? I heard seven shots by the same gun and one from a different gun or position (different sound). This was SIX seconds later not immediately, or 16 seconds later as some reports say. Was the suspect shot by a police sniper or up close? If so why weren't there more different gunshot sounds heard? Witnesses said they saw the suspect and reported to the police several minutes before and the police did nothing about it? They also said there was a lack of Police compared to other rallies, (actors?) Is this some kind of TRUMP SHOW SET UP with fake blood. Not a nice thing to do especially saying someone was killed but I wouldn't put it past Trump to pull something like this. Five or six shots and only one hit? From a sniper rifle only 100 mtrs away? A child could shoot better. And don't get me started on how a normal camera seems to have picked up the bullet in a frame. That's a one in a million chance if you don't have a high speed camera zoomed into the exact position. A lot of questions still need answering. Let's see if Trump says anything about gun control next!",Ugyd83tnPbS5snSqDhR4AaABAg,13272

He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed\"". How majestic is His Love!

He wants you to have the very best. Without you, He will cry. Jesus Christ is the light of the world. Whoever enters through Him will be saved for eternity. Salvation is still possible for you! All you have to do is repent ( turn away ) from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by accepting Him as your Lord & Savior! Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved ( Acts 4:12 ). Please repeat this prayer if you want to experience God's love and your love for Him. ' I renounce satan; I renounce all his works; I renounce all his allurements. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.

We ask all these in the name of Jesus, our God & Savior, Amen. Dear brother/sister, we can only please Him through our Faith in Him. If at any point, we sin from struggle or demonstrated disobedience to Him, we can still ask Him to forgive us by confessing, admitting that we have sinned, and repenting from sin. \"" If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\"" ( 1st John 1:9).

Through speaking, by doing and speaking in all the land. This is the work of God in the last days; He only speaks so that the world may become a world of words, so that each person may be provided and enlightened by His word, and so that the spirit of man would be awakened and he would be clear about the visions. When Jesus came He spread the gospel of the Kingdom of Heaven, and fulfilled the work of redemption by crucifixion. The coming of Jesus the Age of Law and ushered in the Age of Grace. The coming of God incarnate in the last days brought an end to the Age of Grace. He came primarily to speak His words, to use the words to make man perfect, to enlighten and enlighten man, and to remove the place of the obscure God within the heart of man. He did not come to heal, or cast out demons, or to perform miracles, and He did not come to spread the gospel of repentance, or grant man redemption. The practical God came to show that He is real.) Almighty God said KNOWING GOD'S WORK in these TIMES, in MOST PART, is KNOWING GOD INCARNATED in the LAST DAYS, what His main MINISTRY is, and WHAT He PURPOSES to do ON EARTH. I MENTIONED to My THOSE WHO SAID that GOD has COME to EARTH (in the last days) to GIVE an EXAMPLE BEFORE LEAVING. sun How does God show this example? THROUGH SPEECH, THROUGH DOING and SPEAKING THROUGHOUT THE LAND. This is the WORK of GOD in the LAST DAYS; He only SPEAKS so that the EARTH becomes a WORLD of WORDS, so that every PERSON can be PROVIDED and ILLUMINATED by His WORD, and SO that the SPIRIT of MAN AWAKES and he is CLEAR ABOUT the VISIONS. sun In the LAST DAYS, GOD INCARNATE CAME to EARTH MAINLY to SHARE His WORDS. When JESUS came He SPREADED the GOSPEL of the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, and FULFILLED the WORK of REDEMPTION through CRUCIFIXION. He ENDED the AGE OF LAW, and BROUGHT ALL the OLD THINGS to NOTHING. The COMING of JESUS ENDED the AGE OF LAW and USED the AGE OF GRACE. sun The COMING of GOD INCARNATED in the LAST DAYS BRINGS the END to the AGE OF GRACE. folded hands He CAME MAINLY to SPEAK His WORDS, to USE WORDS to MAKE MAN PERFECT, to ILLUMINATE and ILLUMINATE MAN, and to REMOVE the PLACE of vague GOD WITHIN MAN'S HEART. sun folded hands This is NOT the STAGE of WORK that JESUS DID WHEN He came.

On the ONE HAND, the INCARNATION of GOD in the TIME of the LAST DAYS removed the PLACE of the OBSCURE GOD in HUMAN UNDERSTANDINGS, that is WHY the IMAGE of the OBSCURE GOD in the HEARTS of MAN is no LONGER. THROUGH His ACTUAL WORDS and ACTUAL DEEDS, His ACTIONS THROUGHOUT the EARTH, and the unique real and normal work He accomplished with man, He CAUSES MAN to COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND the REALITY of GOD, and REMOVES the LOCATION of the OBSCURE GOD in the HUMAN HEART. sun On the other hand, GOD USES the WORDS spoken by His FLESH to MAKE MAN COMPLETE, and to FULFILL THINGS. This is the WORK of GOD that He WILL FULFILL in the LAST DAYS. folded hands What you should know: 1. God's work is not supernatural, and you should not harbor notions about it. 2.

When JESUS came, the WORK He did REPRESENTED a PART of GOD, BUT in the PRESENT TIME GOD CAME to PERFORM the STAGE ofvthe WORK WHICH was APPROPRIATE, because GOD does NOT REPEATE the SAME work; He is the GOD who is ALWAYS NEW and NEVER OLD, and BECAUSE ALL you SEE NOW are the WORDS and WORKS of a PRACTICAL GOD. sun folded hands From \""The WORD Appears in the Flesh\"". holy book Fulfilled in \""In the beginning He was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"" (John 1:1). ... and (Ezekiel 2:9-10).

The Antichrist chased them all the way into the wilderness of America. We read this in, Rev 13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. Rev 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. Rev 13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. This depicts America, the lamb represents freedom of worship the 2 horns are the north and the south. The fire that came down on the earth in the sight of men is the Atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima where 60, thousand died in one day. This is the reason that our government is going crazy, it is run by Roman Catholics who worship the Pope as their God on earth. We read this in, Rev 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. Rev 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. The Papacy was wounded when Napoleon took the pope captive in the late 1700s and the Pope died in captivity, the goal now is a one world government and a one world religion. These are the reasons that John Kennedy was assassinated, he would not cooperate with their agenda. This is why Donald Trump is dragged through the Justice system and an attempt was made on his life. These insurgents aligned with Rome are in every branch of our government and they are making a circus out of it and the American people have no idea what is going on.

Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pa., squeezed off shots - one of which grazed Trump in the ear - at an outdoor rally in Butler, just outside Pittsburgh. Sources said Crooks was planted on a roof of a manufacturing plant more than 130 yards away from the stage at Butler Farm Show grounds. He was killed by Secret Service snipers. An AR-style rifle was later recovered. Bethel Park is a village 40 miles south of where the Butler rally was held. Why Crooks fired on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is unclear. ___ UPDATE: the FBI now has formally identified the shooter. The FBI hasn't yet publicly released the name of the now dead Trump shooter - but he's a 20 year old Pennsylvania resident who lives close to where the rally was held, in Butler, Pennsylvania. He's been identified, despite him not carrying ID when he was killed. The FBI and local police held a news conference at midnight, EST, Saturday night. From the press conference: The FBI isn't releasing the shooters name yet. They are going to confirm his identity by DNA. They don't yet have a motive for the shooting. VERY little real information was released at the new conference. ___ FBI and police are at the home of the shooter, and have taped off his house. His home is an hour away from the rally. Police are waiting for a warrant to search his house. FBI are asking anybody with knowledge to phone 1 800 CALLFBI *Trump rally shooter killed by Secret Service sniper, officials say* A suspected gunman who opened fire during a rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, for former President Donald Trump was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper, authorities said. One rally attendee was killed and two more were critically wounded, the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday night. The suspect was shot and killed by a member of a Secret Service counter-assault team, two law enforcement sources told CBS News. The gunman was outside of the cordoned-off rally area about 200 to 300 feet from the rally, and was standing on an elevated structure believed to be a shed, the two sources said. The shooter was armed with an AR-style rifle, sources said. Several shots rang out while Trump was speaking on stage at about 6:15 p.m. local time. The former president immediately touch his ear and then crouch to the ground, with his Secret Service agents rushing the stage. Some blood could be seen on his face as he stood up and held up his fist to the crowd. He was rushed out to his motorcade and the Secret Service later confirmed that he was safe. It is still being determined if Trump was struck by a bullet or debris, a law enforcement source said. In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was \shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\"" He went on: \""I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\"" Authorities are investigating the shooting as an attempted assassination, law enforcement sources told CBS News. The FBI said in a statement that it is leading the investigation, with assistance from the Secret Service and state and local agencies. Rally attendee Ben Macer told CBS Pittsburgh that he saw the suspect \""move from roof to roof\"" and told an officer that the gunman \""was on the roof.\"" \""When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that,\"" Macer said. Rep. Mike Kelley of Pennsylvania, who was standing backstage watching Trump speak, told CBS News, \""I believe a lady who was next to me was hit, other people were hit.\"" Dr. Jim Sweetland, an emergency room physician who was at the rally and witnessed the shooting, told CBS News by phone that he administered first aid to a man who had sustained a gunshot wound to the head. \""He was shot in the head, his body was twisted around and wedged between two benches that were in the stands,\"" Sweetland said. \""He was not breathing, he did not have a pulse. He appeared gravely ill.\"" With the help of three people, Sweetland said he was able to get the victim onto a bench and then began administering CPR and chest compressions. \""There was a lot of blood that was spilt on the stands where he lay, as well as brain matter,\"" Sweetland said. Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers then approached, gathered up the victim and took him, presumably to an ambulance, Sweetland said. Republican Senate candidate David McCormick, who was in the front row of the rally, also saw one person shot. \""It was really hard to tell, there was a lot of blood, so it wasn't clear where the bullet had struck him, and how severe the wound was,\"" McCormick told CBS News. \""He looked to be unconscious, but even that's not entirely clear to me.\"" The shooting comes just two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump's motorcade departed Butler Memorial Hospital a little before 9:30 p.m. local time, two sources confirmed to CBS News. It was unclear where he was headed. He had initially been scheduled to travel to his estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, before departing for Milwaukee for the convention.""",Ugx9drAmEWZ1D4QXV154AaABAg,12438

It is amazing they were able to locate the shooter at all when he was that close using scopes with such a limited FOV. Intermediate range angles of attack are usually covered by DHS agents or state police; for example during Trump's appearance at the RNC the Ohio State troopers were providing intermediate range security outside the arena. My guess is some police officer was lazy about covering one side of the building because the building also contained the police HQ for the operation, as revealed by the FBI. The shooter spotted the weakness and scrambled onto the roof and into an angle where it would be hard for the snipers to spot him behind a tree.

It sounds like he then returned to his car, grabbed his fathers rifle, and then climbed on top of the building. They are saying that he didn't climb up the ladder, and I've seen no pictures of the ladder before the shooting so it's likely what police used to access the roof after the shooting. Instead what he used to reach the roof were some air conditioning units. There are multiple reports that police and maybe even the counter snipers saw him on the roof up to 20-30 minutes before he opened fire, and that was quite a bit before Trump took the stage.",UgzHfes2_YxmQ7U58Ch4AaABAg,2828

Their boss has to answer in court why didn't they have that roof covered/secured with the security needed to guard and protect from that area. The excuse right now is it was a slope roof. But the other roofs were slope too and they were secured with the necessary security/secret service for former President Trump.

Apparently, they had no direct communication with the Secret Service, nor could they let them know to take Trump off the stage. There was about two or three minutes from the time that people in the back were barbecuing while they tried to let the police know that somebody was climbing onto a roof, but this was all ignored.Finally, thehead ofthe Secret Service for the United States,Mrs. Cheatham,apparently said that because the roof was pitched and was dangerous, she refused to putofficerson top of the roof as they might fall off.

Thoughts?",UgwIqOYjwiG_ZqBQl-p4AaABAg,801
V3,0.734,0.946,"All attempts of the security and law enforcement agencies to justify themselves are reduced to shifting the onus on the neighbor. The Secret Service hints that the area should have been checked and controlled by the local police. The Sheriff's Department claims to have checked everything and even informed some Secret Service officer on a \suspicious guy\"". The officer claims to have tried to approach the suspect on the roof but the perp pointed his rifle at him and the officer stepped back because he didn't have a gun on him. That's the way their procedure is. According to the counter-sniper, he held the terrorist at gunpoint for over 40 seconds but didn't get the permission to open fire from his commanding officer. At the top of this pyramid, there are anonymous reports that Trump's security has previously informed the Secret Service on threats but the Treasury Department refused to tighten security as hundreds of such threats come, and the budget cannot be stretched forever. All that is material for internal investigations. Eventually this is a domestic affair. From the outside, one can see several fundamental mistakes made by all those responsible for Trump's safety: the Secret Service, the local police, and Trump's private security service. First: the location. Butler, Pennsylvania, might not have many areas where such an event could be held in the open air. Yes, in the open air, because there are definitely no buildings of required capacity. Why build a podium in the open field surrounded by uncontrollable structures on three sides? This had to be a joint responsibility of the Secret Service that is supposed to protect Trump as a former president and Trump's personal security that is supposed to be integrated into his campaign headquarters. These guards may have different ideas of choosing a place. Nevertheless, they simply were obliged to inspect the area in good time and say a categorical 'no' to it. Perhaps someone from Trump's headquarters or the local mayor's office stroke an attitude and insisted on that location. However, there was an option to have security posts not just counter-sniper posts on all the positions that a potential terrorist might have chosen. The Secret Service professionals are trained killer snipers as well, so they should just have put themselves in the shoes of the potential shooter and have checked out the situation, which they are capable of. Thomas Matthew Crooks showed no great tactical skills; he just chose the only roof of the shed available. Should a Secret Service agent (any security guard, whatever) had been on that roof, Crooks would've failed to climb up there. Nothing would've happened. Second: Any security group has duly trained hawk-eyed people who scan the crowd and the area around. As a matter of fact, they wear tinted eye-glasses not for show. They don't want you to know what they look at. They've got to be in line with or slightly behind the protected person but they've got to look in the same direction with him or her. Only in this position, they can become aware of getting prepared for something unpleasant ahead of time, whether it's a sniper on the roof or a lady with some spray paint in the front row. It's necessary that plainclothes agents be in the crowd to have a chance of noticing a strange long-haired guy with a rifle well in advance. Third: The Sheriff's Department wasn't exactly negligent, but its respond to what was going on around it was kind of strange. After spotting someone with a rifle, they should've raised the alarm. The event should've been postponed or even cancelled because the guy wasn't likely to have come for hunting deer. But the Secret Service was highly likely to have immediately announced that they were in charge and the local police were yokels and rednecks. As a result, the Sheriff's Department put the onus on the Secret Service at the very moment when every minute counted, if not every second. For its part, the Secret Service was deliberating whether or not to shoot: \""You never know. What if the guy's waiting for deer? What if this is a paintball gun? In this case there will be a huge scandal if we \""neutralize\"" him.\"" They might have thought that Trump's personal security that actually was part of his campaign headquarters had to make a decision. Fundamentally, a number of mistakes were made at the stage of planning the event and its protection. Ideally, one or two days prior to the event, a joint headquarters is formed to set up security arrangements. It's not an improvisation. It's staff work with maps on location in an effort to reveal vulnerable spots in terms of a shooting attack, breaking through to the podium or even throwing an improvised explosive device. At least, one perfect sniper position wasn't identified. No precautions were taken to obstruct the view from that position. In general, it's very difficult to talk about the professionalism of the operatives who didn't lock the roof of the building opposite. Part of the responsibility has to lie with the commanding officer as he answers for ensuring that the area is cleaned-up in advance, even if it's technically the responsibility of the sheriff. Eventually someone who's declared a commanding officer will be held accountable. And if you see a man with a gun, you make a decision instantly. No situational awareness was maintained. It may be suggested that guards weren't placed properly because they would've been on television cameras and attracted too much attention, which is unacceptable for political and propaganda reasons. Standing at the bottom of the first line of the audience, they couldn't physically see what was happening on the roof opposite. No situation control system was established in advance. No competences among various groups and departments were distributed. In sum, all this is a gross error of all security services and of each one individually. It's so bad that it's unclear how they manage to get recertified. In Russia, it's simply impossible to imagine an uncovered roof as an ideal sniper post at events with the participation of top public officials. Even the pigeons on all of that roofs are in the rank of Captain at the very least. The attempted assassination of Donald Trump is a vivid example of a complete irresponsibility multiplied by political and propaganda components that are understood way too widely. All this takes place at the level of planning and preparation, so the problem is of a systemic rather than situational nature.""",UgwBQKtEaGwJLJ7VeJh4AaABAg,3261

Also, he was a person of interest from the time he entered the rally, why didn't someone go talk to him?

V3,0.686,0.946,Job well done! Great attention to all the technical details. But allow me to mention a few things that you left out. * 26 minutes before shots were fired The shooter was spotted on the roof by a Trump supporter while they were in the area outside of the rally. Within a few minutes dozens had gathered and were shouting and pointing to get the attention of law enforcement. Numerous calls were made to 911 and the local police department. * Even though the advanced protection team identified the building as a prime vulnerability. There was no active perimeter or rooftop security present. Although there were several secret service agents inside the building literally right under the shooter. * Crooks had been noticed hours before the rally by local police. He was photographed and reported as engaging in suspicious behavior. *Although Crooks was registered as a Republican; he also contributed to Biden's campaign in 2020. Registering as a Republican to vote in the primaries is a well-known tactic of some young leftists. Presumably to vote for the least desirable candidate. This common strategy was revealed in some reports during the New Hampshire primaries. Also Crooks was known to regularly wear a mask in public even after the pandemic.

The call, known now as the Raleigh call, was not put through under instruction from two plain clothed guys that listened in to his call.

The questions appear to be biased, aimed at finding a scapegoat to appease voters.

This can lead to a focus on demanding quick answers, even if those answers may not be fully transparent at that moment. 3. **Right to Defense**: The official has the right to defend their position and provide the information that is available without compromising the investigation. This can create a gap between what is expected and what is feasible at that time. 4. **Balance Between Transparency and Procedure**: It is essential to find a balance between the need for transparency and the need to follow proper legal and administrative procedures.

(I'll verify this, but the difference is irrelevant in this case.) At the distances involved, it really doesn't matter. (The 300 WM is far more power/energy than is needed for these distances. Most agencies opt for 338 lapua over the 300 WM for \high power\"" applications...Beyond 1000 yd.) What's most important is the TIMING of the GUNMAN'S \""first shot\"" until the return shot of the government Sniper. There was only 1 video that was focused upon the government snipers from which you could obtain that time difference. ( Hey interesting that this video evaporated after 1 day...Hmmm.) Per the video I measured the time difference to be less than 1 second, (Not the LIE of 26 seconds being reported) which means that the government sniper had; acquired the target, adjusted his scope, and taken his aim LONG BEFORE the gunmen started shooting! Why did he wait to shoot until AFTER the gunman had shot Trump? [Why had the advanced team ignored the most obvious and optimal sniper position and left it unprotected? Why were the government'snipers placed in an UNPROTECTED, Non-optimal position that was nearly in-line with the target? Why did they also ignore the requirements for effective and reliable communications? Why did they fail to create an implement a proper crisis management plan to address a potential slipper scenario?] The only logical conclusion is that he was \""following his orders\"" to ensure that \""dead men tell no tales\""...

But he's now d so they can't interrogate him meaning they didn't want any of this known. They're covering it all up including lib posse running a citywide child testing grounds, where kids across the city and people across whole areas got tested on: too many for reparations. Lib posse also helped Lockheed expand from 2 to 46 states, so USA WANTED them to do this it now seems. They keep Lockheed privatized to give plausible deniability to the USA gov of having anything to do with cases of human testing and usually peeps going into Witsec are convinced to drop the lockheed portion of their cases. Many don't even live long enough to see a case thru like that. Anyhow they were child testing and now it's too embarassing. During the 90's homeless crisis where kids across USA were thrown on the streets, it proved perfect climate for this testing. Kids got forcibilied, abducted, and worse, many didn't make it. And Donnie Brasco had been in town prior and left a city full of kids to later suffer that! So Begay knew and wanted m0b this time around to do this level of stuff and planned to cover it up later.

Kids coming from other cities, said the same was occuring in their cities, which I personally witnessed from Boston, La, New Oreleans, Austin Tx, Seattle, & Salt lake in addition to portland or.

I think they are missed because they are still covering up and creating a history profile as they are called out on unexplained incidences. I presume that the actual truth implicates a corruption level the public has no clue of. It leads me to believe that the individual was targeted due to his psyche profile, then influenced, then perhaps drug-induced to ensure the mission goes through, given a set of instructions and an opening of opportunity as created to allow him to complete it.

The real question is who and why allowed it to happen and to what extent was the assisnation be allowed to exceed. The conduct of the assasin is laughable in its obviousness, literally standing out in the open, pointing a rifle at police, in clear view on a white roof in dark clothing a hundred metres away. They wanted you to know this was the assasin. To begin with i thought the same they wanted to assassinate Trump, but in retrospect i doubt it. This was setup to look like an assassination while he was in no real danger. The bystanders being shot and killed were real, but the ear shot just looks like a blood squib used in movie production. This event has completely solidified Trumps presidency and who does that benefit? Imo it benefits Israel most, and i am of the opinion zionist interests have long controlled the US political, media and banking system. They chose who the presidents are. Trump is all in on Israel, he will ensure the funds will keep on going to them. In the eyes of the world public opinion has massively shifted against israel for obvious reasons. Ensuring Trump wins the presidency will keep Israel in the US good graces, because in the eyes of his supporters he can do no wrong and will likely spout the same garbage the likes of George W Bush did about his war on terrorism. People will eat it up and so Israel continues to receive funds. Or it really was a failed assassination attempt and the CIA and secret services were in on it, which isnt really to big of a stretch either. Don't know, but taking what happened at face value is a joke. I don't know why people believe the likes of a billionaire that did none of the things he promised to do.

V4,0.582,0.913,"You need to consult ANYONE who is familiar with firearms next time you make a video relating to them. The specs you gave on the AR15 would have been more accurate for common models 40 years ago, but wildly generalized and misinformed for modern iterations of the platform. For starters, most modern AR's are not a 20\ barrel length. For decades the standard length AR15 barrel has been 16\"" but they can vary quite a bit depending on manufacturer, purpose of the specific rifle, and user preference. Second, calling a .223 or 556mm round high velocity by comparing it to pistol velocities is like justifying a 600 cc motorcycle as fast because it accelerates faster than a Toyota Carolla. Apples and oranges. It's a quick moving round but it is also a very small round that is actually pretty subpar when it comes to energy on impact at range. Also, magazine capacity isn't simply 20 rounds as commonly available box mags are made in numerous round counts from 5 to 60 rounds with 30 actually being the most common and available. 20 round mags are actually tougher to find than 30 these days. With a crazy number of manufacturers and component options, weight varies wildly, so that's just a waste of time in the video as it may differ significantly from the actual firearm used and has little relevance to the weapon's use. As for the MK 13, I'm not really sure what you called it in the video but MK stands for and is pronounced \""mark\"" and is a reference to the specific modification setup of a firearm and has been used in countless firearms designs for well over a century. For example, if I reference an enfield No. 1 Mk 3* I know what specific modified style of the British Enfield No. 1 setup is being referenced. So, it's a Remington 700 based firearm fitting a certain standard of design alterations designated as MK 13. I hope this helps some in clarification of the firearms discussed, and I really hope you and other youtubers would take the time to not just Google genetic firearms information and provide accurate, informed, and relevant firearms data in videos. There are enough knowledgeable firearms nuts in America who love to talk about firearms that misinformation about basic gun facts is inexcusable and a sign of simple lack of due diligence in research.""",Ugyt48DDL4K6BqsT0IV4AaABAg,3251

I hope for answers, but further, I hope for this to spark unity. It seemed to humble trump a bit, which is needed. His rhetoric has been divisive, he's the easiest man to take out of context and spin what he said to tell whatever story you want the public to hear. He's not a politician; he thinks out loud. He's transparent which is both his appeal and his downfall. I want Americans to stop listening to mainstream media, and really listen to interviews, conversations, and multiple independent sources before forming their opinions.

That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.

But because of all this, the community is effectively \""Self Policing\"" because we look after our neighbours, and that creates a community that trusts eachother. Also guns are cool, they're very efficient in life threatening situations. That's not the point though, by giving everyone the 'ability to kill\"" anything, anytime, is insane. Most people don't trust people, I couldn't imagine how I would feel, knowing that everyone I see could kill me at any time. Keep guns at home, only police have guns in the UK, if you want to defend yourself against mass shootings, make sure everyone has to \""handle guns in public\"" in a very polite and safe shooting range way.

I bet that officer just brushed off the guy and figured he was calling out a cameraman or something that wasn't worth looking into.

He thought fast, and decided to direct the guards to make it look realistic to think he didn't know of the shot beforehand, but also survive it. He then thought thought of the perfect bad*ss pose and line to increase his marketing. Whilst this was happening, the photographers actually were there knowing the of assassin's prescience, being informed by the funders of Crooks, which I'm assuming are the possesses of Biden. They still made their money, but Crooks and the funders failed. Thus, the \Terrainocracy\"" overpowered the Bureaucracy. Democrats, fearful of the power Trump know had, decided to publicly push Biden to step down. This is not only causing a wake up call to how unstable politics are, but also, to how potentially a civil war could breakout.
